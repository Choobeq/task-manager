## Installation
The whole project is in one file - task_manager.py.
The other txt files are only examples and you don't need them as those will be created during executing the code.
Just copy the file to your desire destination and open in your compilator.

## How to use the Task Manager
On the first run, the Task Manager will create a file 'user.txt' and save there a default user 'admin' with 'qwerty' as password.
Using Task Manager you can:
- register new user,
- add task,
- view all tasks,
- view and edit tasks assigned to the currently logged user
- create reports
- view statistics if you are logged as admin user

### Registering new user
